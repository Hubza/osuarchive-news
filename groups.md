# Groups
Groups are here! You can finally look through versions using groups, and this also paves the way for support for other osu! related things, such as skins, osu!droid, and more!

## Open a group
You can simply open a group by clicking it! How easy?

## Search improvements
You can search all groups by searching on the group view page, or if you enter a specific group it'll only search that one!
