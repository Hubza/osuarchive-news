Giant thanks to the osu!archive community, without them I wouldn't have even touched this project again. We've now reached 66 versions, which is insane. ILuvSkins gave me inspiration to continue the site and grow it, which has lead to what it is now.

This isn't all we have, there's plenty more to come! Check out our discord at the header above.

Thanks! -Hubz
